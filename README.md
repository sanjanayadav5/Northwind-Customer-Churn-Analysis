## Problem Statement

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn within the Northwind Traders dataset, a fictional dataset commonly used in data analysis. 
* The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer churn, quantify customer retention, and provide actionable insights to help Northwind retain its customers more effectively. 
* Used SQL queries to evaluate dataset and used POWER BI to visualise it, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions to reduce churn and boost customer loyalty.




###  Key insights:
 Average Time Between Orders


* average days between orders for individual customers. 
* Longer intervals suggest less frequent purchases which might be a risk factor for churn. Some customers have a notably high average time between orders, which might require targeted engagement strategies to reduce churn.


Total Revenue by City

* New York and Memphis are the leading cities in terms of revenue, with $15K and $14K respectively, highlighting their importance as key markets.
* cities like Denver, Los Angeles, and Seattle generate moderate revenue, whereas cities like Salt Lake City and Chicago generate less, indicating varying levels of market penetration and customer engagement.

Customer Segmentation by Purchase Frequency

* The customer base is segmented into Frequent, Regular, and Infrequent buyers.
* A substantial portion of the customer base are infrequent buyers, which might indicate a potential area to bolster engagement and conversion strategies to decrease churn rates.

Churn Rate by City

* Chicago and Las Vegas have a churn rate of 100%, indicating a significant loss of customers which requires immediate attention for churn reduction strategies.
* Other cities like Denver, Los Angeles, and Memphis have a 50% churn rate.
* Cities like Boston, Honolulu, and San Francisco show a 0% churn rate, suggesting strong customer retention in these areas.

Most Frequently Purchased Categories

* Beverages and Dried Fruits are the most frequently purchased categories,
Focusing on these categories might help in planning inventory and marketing strategies.
* Less frequently purchased items include Grains and Oil, which could either be deprioritized or could be targeted for promotional campaigns to boost their sales.
Customer Distribution by Order Value
* 59% of customers make purchases of medium order value, suggesting a balanced spending behavior.
* 38% make low-value orders, and only 3% make high-value orders. There might be an opportunity to upsell to those making medium and low-value orders to increase overall sales.


Risky Customers
* 3% of customers are categorized as high-risk for churn, suggesting a small but critical segment requiring immediate attention.
* 97% are classified as low-risk, indicating a generally stable customer base with lower chances of churn.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

* The highest CLTV is $15,302, followed by $13,800, showing the significant value generated by top customers (Customer ID: 28 and 7).
* A steep drop-off is seen for other customers, suggesting that a small subset of customers drives the majority of revenue, which aligns with the 80/20 rule (Pareto principle).

Total Spend of Top Customers
* The top 3 customers contribute a combined total spend of $17.6K ($8K, $4.9K, and $4.7K), making them key revenue drivers.
* These high-spend customers should be the focus of personalized loyalty programs and retention efforts.

Last 6 Months Orders
* Some customers have high order frequency in the last six months, while others show a decline, which may indicate a risk of disengagement. This highlights opportunities to re-engage customers with declining activity.

Customer Lifetime Value Distribution
* The CLTV chart shows spikes at certain customer IDs (28, 7), reinforcing the significant impact of top customers. The rest of the customer base shows relatively lower CLTV, indicating a potential to increase engagement and spending.

Personalized Campaigns & Loyalty Programs
* The dashboard emphasizes designing targeted marketing campaigns based on purchase behavior and preferences to reduce churn risk.
* Implementing loyalty programs specifically for high-risk customers can help sustain engagement and reduce churn rates.

### Strategic Recommendations:
* Engagement Strategies: Implement loyalty programs or targeted promotions, especially in cities with high churn rates like Chicago and Las Vegas.

* Market Analysis: Deepen customer analysis in cities with high revenue like New York and Memphis to replicate success strategies in lower-performing regions.

* Product Focus: Increase focus on high-selling categories like beverages and dried fruits while exploring promotional strategies to increase the sales of less popular items like grains and oil.
* Segmentation Tactics: Develop tailored marketing strategies for infrequent buyers to convert them into more regular customers, potentially reducing the churn rate.
* Focus on High CLTV Customers: Develop customized offers, loyalty rewards, and engagement strategies for top customers to maximize retention and increase their lifetime value.
* Engage High-Risk Customers: Target the 3% high-risk customers with incentives and personalized outreach to minimize churn.
* Monitor Declining Activity: Regularly track customers showing declining order frequency over the last 6 months to preempt potential churn.
## Potential Analysis
###  Purchase Frequency:
*  Identify trends in order of frequency over time. Are there customers whose purchase frequency sharply declines before churn?

#

*  Calculate metrics like the average time between orders for different customer segments (e.g., frequent vs. infrequent buyers).

### Order size 

* Explore the distribution of order value.Are there customer groups consistently placing smaller orders, potentially indicating a higher churn risk?

#
* Analyze the most frequently purchased categories before and after churn events. Did their buying habits shift towards different product lines?

* Leverage customer location data (if available) to investigate churn rates by region. Are there specific locations with higher churn?

#

* Explore correlations between location and purchase behavior. Do buying patterns differ significantly across regions?

#

* Assign a "risk score" to each customer based on factors like purchase frequency decline, reduced order value, or specific product category abandonment.

#
* Utilize customer lifetime value (CLTV) calculations to prioritize retention efforts. Customers with high CLTV who exhibit concerning behavior patterns might require immediate intervention.

  * Step 1: Calculate customer order frequency over the last 6 months
